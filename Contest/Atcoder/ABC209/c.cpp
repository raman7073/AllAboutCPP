if C is sorted in the increasing order, we can see that the number of possibilities for
A is the product of
(Ciâˆ’i+1).
 Ex:
  3 4
  we can use 3 numbers from c1 and 3 numbers from c2 so answer = 3*3 = 9
  as they are in increasing order the  previous number is always there in further number.

  1 ->2,3,4
  2 ->1,3,4
  3 ->1,2,4
  total is 9
